# Challenge 32 - I Hate Mathematics

## Python

To solve this challenge I wrote a Python script.

With Python 3.7:

```
$ python code.py
** RingZer0 CTF Challenge 32 **

> Starting challenge
> Equation found: 348 + 0x17e8 - 1000100100110 = ?
> Equation converted: 348 + 6120 - 4390 = ?
> Equation solved: 348 + 6120 - 4390 = 2078
> Sending hash (time used: 0.32 seconds)
Success: FLAG-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

The FLAG needs then to be submitted to the challenge page. 
Be aware that I replaced the flag value, so no spoiler there ;).

Have fun!
