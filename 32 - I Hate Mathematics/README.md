# Challenge 32 - I Hate Mathematics

## Python

To solve this challenge I wrote a Python script.

With Python 3.7:

```
$ python code.py
** RingZer0 CTF Challenge 32 **
Enter Cookie PHPSESSID: i5mkrrou0eker2kfv79thqrto3
> Starting challenge
> Equation found: 7449 + 0x1eb6 - 1100000100000
> Equation converted: 7449 + 7862 - 6176
> Equation solved: 9135
> Sending hash (time used: 0.35 seconds)
Success: FLAG-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

The FLAG needs then to be submitted to the challenge page. 
Be aware that I replaced the flag value, so no spoiler there ;).

Have fun!
