# Challenge 56 - Hash Breaker


## Python

To solve this challenge I wrote a Python script.

With Python 3.7:

```
$ python code.py
** RingZer0 CTF Challenge 56 **
Enter cookie PHPSESSID: [Your cookie session id here]
> Starting challenge
> SHA1 hash value found: edd4ca72cd945eec357314a12d2af71eed916a5f
> Reverse lookup successful: 3070
> Sending hash (time used: 0.97 seconds)
Success: FLAG-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

The FLAG needs then to be submitted to the challenge page. 
Be aware that I replaced the flag value, so no spoiler there ;).

Have fun!
